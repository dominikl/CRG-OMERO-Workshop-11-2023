    "mc is provided by the minio project and is described as \"a modern alternative to UNIX commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff, find etc.\" The quickstart guide can be found under https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide.html. For our purposes we will focus on how to use it to upload and manage data in S3.\n",
